# Test Plan (quick checklist)

- [ ] Build (x64) succeeds locally.
- [ ] DLL copied to Modules path.
- [ ] Game starts without crash.
- [ ] Create Campaign -> enter map -> no crash.
- [ ] If EnableSaveTests true: Save -> Exit -> Load -> no corruption.
- [ ] Collect ModLogs and attach last 40 lines if failure.
